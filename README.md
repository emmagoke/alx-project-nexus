## üöÄ Project: Online Poll System

This project is the backend for a real-time online polling application. It focuses on building scalable APIs, optimizing database schemas for frequent operations, and providing clear, interactive documentation.

### üéØ Project Goals

- **API Development:** Build robust RESTful APIs for creating polls, casting votes, and fetching results in real-time.
- **Database Efficiency:** Design and implement a PostgreSQL schema optimized for high-frequency read/write operations.
- **Documentation:** Provide detailed and interactive API documentation using Swagger (OpenAPI).

### ‚ú® Key Features

- **Poll Management:** Endpoints to create polls with multiple options, including metadata like creation and expiry dates.
- **Secure Voting System:** APIs for users to cast votes, with validation implemented to prevent duplicate voting.
- **Real-Time Results:** Efficient query design for on-the-fly calculation of vote counts for each poll option.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Python, Django, Django REST Framework
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Asynchronous Tasks:** Celery, RabbitMQ
- **API Documentation:** Swagger (via `drf-yasg` or `drf-spectacular`)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions

### üìÑ API Documentation

The API is documented using Swagger. Once the server is running, you can access the interactive documentation at:

**`http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/docs/`**

### ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

#### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- PostgreSQL
- Docker (Optional, for containerized setup)

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/alx-project-nexus.git
    cd alx-project-nexus
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    - Add your database credentials and other settings (see `.env.example` if available).
    ```
    SECRET_KEY='your-secret-key'
    DEBUG=True
    DB_NAME='your_db_name'
    DB_USER='your_db_user'
    DB_PASSWORD='your_db_password'
    ```
5.  **Run database migrations:**
    ```sh
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
6.  **Start the development server:**
    `sh
    python manage.py runserver
    `
    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## üìö ALX ProDev Learning Journey

> This section serves as a living document of my journey through the ProDev Backend Engineering program. It's a space to consolidate notes, code snippets, and key takeaways.

### Key Technologies

- **Python:** Advanced concepts, best practices, and performance optimization.
- **Django:** Deep dive into the framework, including the ORM, middleware, and signals.
- **REST APIs:** Principles of REST, building APIs with Django REST Framework, authentication, and permissions.
- **GraphQL:** Understanding the differences from REST, building efficient data queries.
- **Docker:** Containerizing Django applications for development and production.
- **CI/CD:** Automating testing and deployment pipelines with GitHub Actions.

### Core Concepts

- **Database Design:** Strategies for designing scalable and efficient relational database schemas. Normalization vs. Denormalization.
- **Asynchronous Programming:** Using Celery and RabbitMQ to manage background tasks and improve application responsiveness.
- **Caching Strategies:** Implementing caching (e.g., with Redis) to reduce database load and speed up response times.

### Challenges & Solutions

_(This is a space to document specific challenges faced during projects and the solutions implemented. For example:)_

- **Challenge:** N+1 query problem when fetching nested data.
- **Solution:** Used `select_related` and `prefetch_related` in Django QuerySets to optimize database access.

## ü§ù Collaboration

I am actively seeking to collaborate with:

- **Fellow ProDev Backend Learners:** To exchange ideas, review code, and develop synergies.
- **ProDev Frontend Learners:** My API endpoints are ready to be consumed! If you are building a frontend application and need a backend, feel free to connect.
